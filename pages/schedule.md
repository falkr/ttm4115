# Schedule


For each unit, we follow the same schedule:

* You will receive a Blackboard announcement with a link to preparation material. (But even without the announcement, the preparation material is already accessible on this website.)
* We meet on **Thursdays at 14:15** in [Hovedbygningen, room GL-HB 326](https://link.mazemap.com/Tg8i3seb), where we start with the individual RAT and the team RAT, ca 45 minutes.
* We continue with the teamwork for that week.
* On Tuesdays in the following week between 14:15 and 16:00, different things may happen:
  * You can meet you team independently on campus to finish the teamwork or work on the semester project.
  * We have a (digital) question and answer class.



The first lecture in 2025 is on **Thursday, Jan. 9th at 14:15**.
