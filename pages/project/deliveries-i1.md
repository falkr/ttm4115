# Feedback on Version 1

* This is an individual delivery, each student has to deliver their own solution.
* Focus is on reflection and providing feedback on the system specification of another team.


In the announcement for the delivery you find a table that assigns a team to you. This is the team you should provide feedback to.

* Your other team members get assigned a different team than you.
* You will get the same team assigned also after delivery 2


Find the delivery of the team (the PDF file) and the feedback document (DOCX) and download them. 

* Read through their delivery
* Use their feedback document and fill it out 
* Address all relevant issues you find. 
* Pay extra attention on the team's request for comments and feedback.
* See if you agree or disagree with their own evaluation.
* Try to be as direct as possible.
* Be constructive and try to suggest improvements. Focus on that the feedback is useful to the team. It should improve their next delivery.
* You can weave your feedback into the team's own reflection, in Word format. 
* It's okay to include screenshots (maybe partial ones) that you annotate if that makes things easier. (Then you may need more space than indicated above.)
* The feedback you give is not anonymous. This is on purpose, so a team might ask you for clarifications (though this is probably not necessary).






## Individual Reflection

This is a preparation for your individual delivery I3 at the end of the semester. You will probably end up with ca. 1 page of content. You can address everything about the system, the process, the team, the learning goals, your own learning, insights, ... that affects this course.

You don't have to deliver this document. Keep it for your own record. It will help your for the final individual delivery, the essay.


* The reflection may be about yourself, your team, the other team you got assigned. (Most likely a combination.)
* You can use a comparison between your team and the other team as a source of starting points to think.
* You may share your feedback and observations with your team so that you can improve your process or system.
