# Requirements and Design Thinking


# Team Setup

* Assign team roles, just like last week. 
* See if you had any improvements or follow-ups from last week, and act on them.


# Initial System Ideas

Go through your initial system ideas that everyone developed individually. 
Find commonalities, and develop a merged list of ideas on the whiteboard. 
Evaluate them with regard to suitability for this course.


**Select one or two of them to use in the design workshop today.**

These do not have to be your final choices for the system that you end up working with this semester. 
During the design workshop this week, you should elaborate one or two ideas. 
You will then write a Vision and Scope Document for one of these suggestions for this week. 

For delivery T1 you also need to create such a document describing your system.
This _can_ be already the one you develop now, but you may find out that you have a better idea. 
Then I recommend to develop another document. 
It is usually not hard to write another Vision and Scope document once you have gone through it for the first time. 
Rather develop a new one than sticking with a system idea that you don't like.


# Tiles Workshop

Go through the design workshop as guided. 
Since it varies a lot how long one iterations takes, you may want to do it for two ideas or only one. 
The main goal is that you end up with one system idea that you feel comfortable with to write a Vision and Scope document. 
As said above, this does not have to be the final system for your semester project, but it may be.


* Take a picture of your table for later reference.
* The workshop usually results in an _Elevator Pitch_ that summarizes the system idea. 
Instead, you should build a partial (and preliminary) Vision and Scope Document, as described in the next section.



# Partial Vision and Scope Document

Based on your idea, create a preliminary Vision and Scope Document. 
The entire document should be short and concise, probably only about two to three pages. 
Capture the following sections:

* **Background:** A better name for this section is probably **"The Problem"**, because it needs to introduce why the system is actually needed. 
It provides information about the context of the system to make the vision more understandable and motivate it.
  * It is important that this part focuses on the context of the system, the environment, the problem and **not** the system itself. 
  * See also Compendium, Vision and Scope Document, p.576, 1.1
* **Vision Statement:** This is the most important item. 
Formulate a vision for your system that will guide your development, and explain the system also to others. 
  * See Compendium, Vision and Scope Document, p.577, 1.5
* **Objectives:** Try to formulate specific goals that the system should achieve, and that are somehow measurable. 
This should guide the technical development, and contribute to achieve the vision.
  * See Compendium, Vision and Scope Document, p.576, 1.3
* **Stakeholders:** Describe briefly the stakeholders that are important for the system. What is important to them? 
  * See Compendium, Vision and Scope Document, p.579, 3.1
* **Risks:** Describe briefly the main risks relevant for the system. Which are they, how can they be handled or reduced? 
  * See Compendium, Vision and Scope Document, p.577, 1.6
* **Major Features:** Describe briefly the major features of the system. These will help you to describe use case next week. You don't have to present a feature diagram, just make a list of 3 to 5 main features and explain them briefly.
  * See Compendium, Vision and Scope Document, p.578, 1.6

**Deliver to Blackboard:** You need to deliver the preliminary document this week. As said above, this is not the final delivery. 
You can change the system. This delivery is just a milestone to get done, even if you change it.


# Peer Review of Vision and Scope Document

Ask another team for their document. This may require some coordination, since you have scheduled different timeslots. 
Have a look in the team overview diagram which teams may already be ready, and contact them on Teams. 

* Use the channel **Exchange** on Teams.
* In the Exchange channel, find a document called _Unit 2 - Vision and Scope Exchange.docx_ where you list which team you review.
* Write your comments as normal text, but with colored background, so that the comments are visible in an exported PDF.

**Deliver to Blackboard:** Deliver the document that you provided comments for on Blackboard.

# Team Reflection for This Unit 

* Add another section to the team reflection document, just like last week. 

# Individual Reflection

* Fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cgahCS-CZ0SluluzdZZ8BSxiepoCd7lKk70IThBWqdJUQUQxNEVLOTBZMDZGNkJBM1Y2NjZCTzhWSi4u" class="arrow">individual reflection survey</a>.
* Copy the answers into a document that you maintain on your own.
* Add any additional observations to your reflection diary.
