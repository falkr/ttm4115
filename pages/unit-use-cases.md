# Use Cases

## Good Use Cases

What are characteristics of good use cases?

1. Come up with individual suggestions for good use cases (3 minutes)
2. Collect on a whiteboard or document.
3. Discuss and select the three most important. (Have a backlog with the others.)


During the discussion in the auditorium, we will use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FsNzkSbpG-1jrUbPr_zRBiAdg_jr_Zt6LLNF52WcKU/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this document</a> to collect all suggestions.

## Use Case Levels

Not all use cases are at the same level. Alistair Cockburn proposes to sort them according to the levels inspired by a horizon, as shown below.

## Team: Use Case Levels 1

Below you find a collection of use cases from different systems. At the moment, they are all placed at the sea level, but most of them don't belong there.

1. Make a copy of the diagram below. 
2. Discuss and move all use cases to the level that fits best.

## Good Use Cases at Sea-Level

A good use case specification requires good use cases especially at the sea-level. A guideline for use cases at sea-level are the following:

* Can the user achieve their goals in this use case within 2 to 20 minutes?
* Can users have a coffee break after the use case?
* Can the primary actor go away happy after achieving the goal?
* Does the use case have 3 to 8 steps?


If use cases are **too high-level**:

- Break them down
- Provide details

If use cases are **too low-level**:

- relate to a higher level use case
- if it is a clam: integrate as a step into another use case
- ask the question *why* the actor is doing something
- remove details and merge steps


## Team: Use Case Levels 2

You should now create a map with the horizon from above and add the first use cases for your system. Try to find **all use cases at the sea-level** and **all use cases above the sea level**. Also, add **some** use cases below the sea level.



### Hints:

* **Individual Round First:** Let everyone write down many use cases, then write them down and merge them.
* **Several Pages:** You can have several pages within one document. For this task, three pages sounds good. Try to relate use cases at different levels together if they are connected. (One use case helps implementing another one.)
* Make a copy of the document below. 
* **Submit on Blackboard:** Submit the preliminary versions of the use cases on Blackboard by the end of the day.
