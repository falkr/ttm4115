# Feedback on Version 2

* This is an individual delivery, each student has to deliver their own solution.
* Focus is on reflection and providing feedback on the system specification of another team.


* Address all relevant issues you find. 
* Pay extra attention on the team's request for comments and feedback.
* See if you agree or disagree with their own evaluation.
* Try to be as direct as possible.
* Be constructive and try to suggest improvements. Focus on that the feedback is useful to the team. It should improve their next delivery.
* You can weave your feedback into the team's own reflection, in Word format. 
* It's okay to include screenshots (maybe partial ones) that you annotate if that makes things easier. (Then you may need more space than indicated above.)
* The feedback you give is not anonymous. This is on purpose, so a team might ask you for clarifications (though this is probably not necessary).
