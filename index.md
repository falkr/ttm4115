## Step 6: Final Diagram

Based on the feedback you received, prepare a final diagram. Make sure that the layout is readable and decent, that the UML syntax is correct, and that the diagram "works", in the sense that it conveys the important information about the system in a suitable way.

**Store the Diagram as a PDF (available to all team members.) 

Store a copy on Padlet:

### Team Conventions

Browse through the suggestions for teamwork from the last session (on the Teams Padlet). Discuss which conventions you want to have in your team. Be specific. Write them down in a document, and share this document. (For instance in a shared Drive folder.) This document is also part of your final delivery. You should review it whenever you see fit.

<p>Then, the rest of that sentence is just a list of stuff you could maybe possibly
use the pattern for. Not very illuminating unless your use case happens to be in
that list. <em>My</em> pithy tagline for the Command pattern is:</p>
<p><strong>A command is a <em><span name="latin">reified</span> method call</em>.</strong></p>
<aside name="latin"><p>Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting users parameterize clients

operations.</p>

<!--<h1 class="book"><a href="/">Game Programming Patterns</a><span class="section"><a href="design-patterns-revisited.html">Design Patterns Revisited</a></span></h1>-->
<p>Command is one of my favorite patterns. Most large programs I write, games or
otherwise, end up using it somewhere. When I&#8217;ve used it in the right place, it&#8217;s
neatly untangled some really gnarly code. For such a swell pattern, the Gang of
Four has a predictably abstruse description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting users parameterize clients
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable
operations.</p>
