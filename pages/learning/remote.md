# Remote Team Instructions


Collect your RATs from us on Thursdays at 14:15 in the classroom.

### Individual RAT

* Solve the individual RATs at first.
* Use 20 minutes at maximum, but often you will need less time.
* Work alone during the individual RATs.
* Do not talk to each other.
* Do not use any helping material.


After the time is up, collect all the individual RATs and put them on one stack. Do not go back and look at them during the team round.

### Team RAT

* Solve the team RAT together. 
* Use one iPhone with the NÃ¸tteknekker app.
* Discuss the proper answer, do not simply vote for a solution.
* Make sure everyone contributes in the discussion.
* Note your final score on the team RAT paper.


### Teamwork

Have a short break, then continue with the teamwork for the week.
