# Feedback on Version 1

* This is an individual delivery, each student has to deliver their own solution.
* Focus is on reflection and providing feedback on the system specification of another team.




## Individual Reflection

This is a preparation for your individual delivery I3 at the end of the semester. You will probably end up with ca. 1 page of content. You can address everything about the system, the process, the team, the learning goals, your own learning, insights, ... that affects this course.

You don't have to deliver this document. Keep it for your own record. 


* The reflection may be about yourself, your team, the other team you got assigned. (Most likely a combination.)
* You can use a comparison between your team and the other team as a source of starting points to think.
* You may share your feedback and observations with your team so that you can improve your process or system.
