## Question 1

:rat:What does it mean when we speak about "degrees" of UML?

1. Everything is a model, also code, so talking about "degrees of UML" is not really helpful.
2. UML can be used in an informal way, for instance when sketching something on a whiteboard.
3. To be valuable, models need to be detailed and formal.
4. Using "UML as a Blueprint" means to automatically generate code from the UML models.

## Question 2

:rat:About modeling in general, which one of the following statements is true?

1. A model is a detailed digital representation of the reality.
2. UML only describes a notation for models.
3. A diagram is like a window into a model.
4. A modeling language must be graphical, otherwise it does not serve its purpose.

## Question 3

:rat:Which of the following statements on models and code is **false**?

1. UML is so expressive that it corresponds to code.
2. Code is also a model, but only describes the implementation of the software.
3. Code does not tell you how the software is to be used or by whom.
4. To understand a system that is only described by code, you have to understand the code.

## Question 4

:rat:What are the reasons to invest time into preparing a system model, for instance in UML?

1. Testing will be practically unnecessary.
2. Since UML is precise, the implementation comes automatically.
3. In many development processes, modeling is a mandatory activity.
4. All project participants can gain a better understanding.

## Question 5

:rat:What do deployment diagrams show?

1. The logical elements of the system.
2. How software is assigned to hardware.
3. How the pieces of the system communicate.
4. Both how software is assigned to hardware and how the pieces of the system communicate.

## Question 6

:rat:Which of the following statements is true:

1. artifacts cannot represent executable files
2. nodes cannot represent execution environments
3. devices cannot model an application server
4. artifacts cannot represent library files

## Question 7

:rat:Which stereotypes fits best into the picture (at their respective placeholders)?

1. (1) artifact, (2) manifest, (3) device
2. (1) artifact, (2) deploy, (3) device
3. (1) device, (2) deploy, (3) artifact
4. (1) deploy, (2) artifact, (3) device

## Question 8

:rat:What should a deployment diagram show?

1. The more complete a deployment diagram is, the more useful it is during the actual deployment.
2. Some details always remain hidden.
3. It is important to only show relevant details of a system.
4. A deployment diagram should be complete.

## Question 9

:rat:Which relationship or connection between two elements can also be represented by nesting,
i.e., by drawing one node into another one?

1. communication
2. manifest
3. dependency between two artifacts
4. deploy

## Question 10

:rat:Deployment diagrams...

1. Are useful at all stages of development.
2. Are useful at all later stages of development.
3. Are useful during system deployment.
4. Are useful during the system implementation.
