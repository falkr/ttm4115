# Learning

<mark>This course combines team-based learning with a semester project.</mark>
During the course, you will develop a system together with your teammates. The units each week support you during this task, from a requirements analysis, use case analysis towards a robust system specification and design that you then implement. During the semester you will need to hand in deliveries that document the different stages of your system. This is similar to a process in industry you will encounter later, just a bit adapted so it fits into a semester.

Though there is lots of team work, there is enough room for you to also work individually. The course requires preparation each week, which you can complete at your own speed and schedule. This preparation gives you the basic knowledge and understanding to work together, and it will be tested in class so that you get immediate feedback on your own progress.

# Grading

<mark>There is no final written exam in the course.</mark> 
The grading scheme is based on the RATs (quizzes) during class and the deliveries you hand in as teams as well as the ones you do individually. 
All these items give enough material for robust and balanced grading.

# Peer Evaluation

With the delivery of T3 you also deliver a peer review of your teammates. 
This evaluation assigns points to your teammates, and rewards them for good contributions to the teamwork.

This is how it works technically:

- You have 100 points.
- You distribute these 100 points among the other team members. (You don't give points to yourself.)
- In a team with 6 students, this means that you distribute 100 points among the 5 other members.

After the submission, everyone gets a report on the points they have received.

- Everyone can see which points they received, but not from whom.
- The points count towards a score.
- The score is multiplied with the grade for the team project.

# System Ideas

As part of this course, you will build a system of your choice throughout the semester together with the other students in your team. In the beginning of the course, we will go through a design workshop that helps you to develop ideas. 

### Watch Videos from Previous Years
As a preparation for this, have a look at the results from the students of last years. Each team created a video of their system. **Watch *some* of the videos**, to get an impression of the kind of system we look for. 

* [Videos from 2018](videos-2018.html)
* [Videos from 2017](videos-2017.html)
* [Videos from 2016](https://mediasite.ntnu.no/Mediasite/Catalog/catalogs/ttm4115-studentvideoer-v16) (Requires NTNU login.)

### Three Own Ideas

**Write down three ideas for systems.** These do not have to be mature ideas or well-thought-out, since you will work on them in your teams. However, some raw material in form of initial ideas is important and valuable in that process. 


# Boarding Survey

Please **complete the boarding survey** as soon as possible, if you have not already done it.
