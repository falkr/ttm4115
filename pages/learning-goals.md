# Learning Goals


In this course you will learn about systems in which communication is an important part of functionality. We will study technologies to build these systems, how communication protocols can be used in combination with components and program code.

You will also learn how to describe these types of systems. We will create system models with various notations, at various levels of detail and with different degree of rigor. This includes formal modeling in terms of state machines, but also simple and effective sketches of the system on a whiteboard. As part of this, you will learn how to think in states and transitions, and how to describe complex interactions efficiently.

Part of system development is also the coordination of a team of developers and the management of resources. You will therefore learn about development processes and directly experience the dynamics in a team.

This means there are three layers of things to learn in this course: **Technologies**, how to **specify** them, and how to organize a **development project and team**.
Maybe we could have a separate course on each of them â€” there would be more than enough to learn for any of these.
But in this course, it is especially the combination of these three layers. 
If you are working as an engineer in any realistic project, elements from all of these three layers matter, are interconnected with each other and lead to a complex problem. 
Just being good ad one of these levels is not sufficient.



The following are the learning goals in this course. I think they are well-aligned with what a future employer will expect from you. All goals should be useful in many situations and roles within technology.
