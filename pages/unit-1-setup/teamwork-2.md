# Balances in Teamwork

Ideally, your team works in a balanced way. Below with examples for balances you should be aware of:

* **Level of Talking:** Is there too much talking going on? Are there some persons that talk all the time, while others say almost nothing? 
* **Level of Focus:** Are you working focused enough so that you reach your goal?
* **Attitudes: Critical vs. Na√Øve:** Does your team just blindly accept any contribution, or do you dare to challenge each other's ideas in a constructive way?

These are just examples of balances. 

* Find the document **Balances in Teamwork Template.pptx** and make a copy.
* Go through each page, and fill out the table.
* Discuss guidelines for working with each other.
* Conclude on the last page with expectations that you have towards each other.

# Team Reflection for This Unit 

It may seem like an overhead to reflect already now during the setup and with these relatively simple tasks. But this team reflection should become a routine from now on. Fill out the section for today's week:

### Roles

Reflect about the following points:

* How did you assign roles today?
* Are the roles clear? Do you need to change them?

### Improvements

Reflect about the following points:

* Is there anything that you can do to improve the way you work?
* What are things you want to observe or follow up on next week?
* Did you actually improve things you noted last time? (This is the first time today.)


### Today's Performance

Reflect about the following points:

* Did you reach the goals?
* What could be improved? 

:aside: This team reflection should become a natural routine for each week. 


# Individual Reflection

Each week you should in addition complete an **individual reflection**, that makes up your **individual reflection diary**. These reflections will help you to collect material for the individual deliveries.
To ensure progress during the semester and also as some form of feedback to us, the individual reflection is kicked off with an individual reflection survey.

* Fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cgahCS-CZ0SluluzdZZ8BSxiepoCd7lKk70IThBWqdJUQUQxNEVLOTBZMDZGNkJBM1Y2NjZCTzhWSi4u" class="arrow">individual reflection survey</a>.
* Copy the answers into a document that you maintain on your own.
* Add any additional, maybe more private, observations to your reflection notes.
