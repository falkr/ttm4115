<h1 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h1>
<p>During requirements engineering, we are focused on the needs of the users and the stakeholders of the systems. We don’t yet think of how to implement or how to structure the system. Maybe some of the structure is indirectly obvious because we know users will use a mobile phone or a PC, and that there is a data center involved. But during requirements engineering we do not yet decompose the system into more fine-grained components.</p>
<p>Before we think about the system, we first structure its functionality as seen from the outside, and for that we describe the system’s <strong>use cases</strong>. This forces us to ask questions like <em>“Which are the (five) most important jobs a user wants to accomplish?”</em> We say <em>five</em> here because that gives you an idea for the number of high-level use cases that we should think of in the first place. (There may be more finer-grained use cases.)</p>
<p>Having good use cases is often undervalued. But it is exactly in this phase where clever thinking and a thorough process pays off manyfold. Use cases are at a level where we work so specific that we can find problems with our understanding of the user requirements, and we can identify inconsistencies within the requirements. We start to get an idea how much effort the system will probably take, although that requires some experience. We can also understand dead ends, i.e., solutions that will probably not work, or some that won’t add any value to the system or product.</p>

<p>I have an example: As you know, we write the RATs for this course on paper, and I made a Python program to read in the codes you submit and then generate all feedback from it. This is a very small software project, but even here use cases pay off. Before I started implementing the first version of the program, I made the following diagram:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/use-cases/teampy.jpg" alt="A simple sketch of the use cases for the system to read in RAT results. Even though this was a simple diagram, it saved a lot of work as it revealed one of the use cases to be unnecessary." width="100%"/>

<aside name="figures/use-cases/teampy.jpg"><p><p>A simple sketch of the use cases for the system to read in RAT results. Even though this was a simple diagram, it saved a lot of work as it revealed one of the use cases to be unnecessary.</p>
</p></aside>
</div>
<p><strong>This is a use case diagram.</strong> It describes the main functions a system provides to its environment, depicted as actors. Here, the main actors are <em>teacher</em> and <em>student</em>. As you can see, there is a use case <em>Enter Results</em>. Originally, I thought this could be done by students on their own, using a web formular. However, as you know, during the RAT you are not allowed to use your phone, so how should we have done this? Also, how to ensure that everyone is reporting their own, correct results? Just by thinking at this level of use cases I then decided that this was a task for the teaching assistant, and changed the use case.</p>
<p>You may think now that you could have done this also without use cases, just by thinking about the system. But this is exactly what we are talking about: The use cases make your thinking on a high level about the system visible to your development team, your boss, your customers, and yourself. This is why use cases are important, and why skipping them can cost you time and money.</p>

<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>

<div class="goals"><p>The learning goals specific for this week are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appreciate the value of thinking in terms of use cases.</li>
<li>Creating use case overview diagrams and use case tables.</li>
<li>Sorting use cases according to their level of detail.</li>
<li>Breaking use cases into finer ones, or aggregating them into more high-level ones.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p><strong>Read carefully through the following book chapter from the compendium:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Software Requirements, Third Edition Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty, 2013, Microsoft Press. (In the Digital Compendium, via Blackboard) <strong>Chapter 8: Understanding User Requirements.</strong> pp 143-165 (22 pages).
<ul>
<li>This chapter also introduces <em>user stories</em>, which are similar to use cases and later used in agile methods. You can focus on use cases for now.</li>
<li>The relationships <em>extend</em> and <em>include</em> are subtle. Read through but don’t worry too much about them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="use-case-levels">Use Case Levels</h1>
<p><em>You should read through the following material, but you don’t have to remember it for the RAT.</em></p>
<p>Not all use cases are at the same level. Alistair Cockburn proposes in his book <em>Writing Effective Use Cases</em> to sort them according to the levels inspired by a horizon, as shown in the table below.</p>

			<li>Involve multiple user goals.</li>
			<li>Execute over hours, days, or weeks.</li>

This hierarchy distinguished use cases at three levels: 

* In the middle, we have the level of **user goals**, represented by the **sea-level**. These are the use cases with the greatest interest for us and that we should spend most time with. They are at a medium level of detail compared to the other levels. Think of a function like _Register Student Information_ as part of a loan application system.
* At the top, there are use cases that represent **summary goals**. They describe high-level goals and why the system exist, but are a bit abstract so that it may be difficult to be sure how they are implemented. On this summary goal level, we distinguish between the very high level **cloud**, of which  a system only should have very few. For the loan application system, _Offer Student Loans_ would be such a use case. One step further down we have **kites**, which describe use cases that are a bit more concrete than cloud-levels. An example is _Check Student Loan Credibility_. 
* At the bottom, we have the level for **subfunctions**. Here, we can have useful use cases that we characterize as **fishes**. _Check Submitted Formular_ may be a function related to several goals in the system, and necessary, but is itself not a goal of a user. It's more a detailed subfunction. Below the fishes, there are even more low-level use cases, called **clams**. They are so low-level that we shouldn't even write them down. An example would be _Enter Student Name_. Instead, these should be integrated into higher level use cases. (Sorry, clams...)  




<h2 id="good-use-cases-at-sea-level">Good Use Cases at Sea-Level</h2>
<p>A good use case specification requires good use cases especially at the sea-level. Now you may also appreciate the analogy with the sky, the sea-level and the water. The ones in the sky are a bit fluffy and abstract, but provide the necessary goals. The ones under water are necessary, but you can get lost in them. And the ones you should focus on are at the sea-level. Good guidelines for use cases at the sea-level are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the user achieve their goals in this use case within 2 to 20 minutes?</li>
<li>Can users have a coffee break after the use case?</li>
<li>Can the primary actor go away happy after achieving the goal?</li>
<li>Does the use case have 3 to 8 steps?</li>
</ul>
<p>What should you do when use cases are <strong>too high-level</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>break a use case down into smaller ones</li>
<li>provide details</li>
<li>ask <em>how</em> the system achieves a function</li>
</ul>
<p>If use cases are <strong>too low-level</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>relate to a higher level use case</li>
<li>if it is a clam: integrate as a step into another use case</li>
<li>ask the question <em>why</em> the actor is doing something</li>
<li>remove details and merge steps</li>
</ul>
