# Delivery I1

* This is an individual delivery, each student has to deliver their own solution.
* Focus is on reflection and providing feedback on the delivery of T1.
* This particular delivery I1 is not graded directly, but serves for you as input for I3.
* The delivery consists of **two separate documents.**


## Input

As input, you use the following:

* The delivery T1 of another team.
* The delivery T1 of your own team.

You will find a list of team assignments on Blackboard, where you can also download the deliveries T1 of that other team.




## Content

* **Document 1: Feedback to the other team.** This document will be made available to the other team.
* **Document 2: Reflection and insights for own team.** This document will remain private.

## Document 1: Providing Feedback

In the document, provide feedback to the other team. Structure your feedback according to the following points:

1. Background
2. Vision
3. Objectives
4. Stakeholders
5. Use Case Diagram for Overview
6. Use Cases in Table Form
7. Deployment Diagram
8. **Overall Feedback / Recommendation**

Depending on the delivery, there may be more or less to say about each of the points. 

* Try to be as direct as possible.
* Try to be constructive, i.e., suggest improvements.
* The feedback should not be long --- possibly one or two pages are enough.
* Focus on that the feedback is useful to the team. It should really improve their delivery in this course.
* It's okay to include screenshots (maybe partial ones) that you annotate if that makes things easier. (Then you may need more space than indicated above.)


## Document 2: Reflection

This is a preparation for your individual delivery I3 at the end of the semester. You will probably end up with ca. 1 page of content. You can address everything about the system, the process, the team, the learning goals, your own learning, insights, ... that affects this course. 


* The reflection may be about yourself, your team, the other team you got assigned. (Most likely a combination.)
* You can use a comparison between your team and the other team as a source of starting points to think.
* You may share your feedback and observations with your team so that you can improve your process or system.
