* **Monday 10:15-12:00** Weekly Tests (digital, Zoom) and summary from the week before
* **Friday 12:15-16:00** Teamwork on week activities
* In some weeks, you need to schedule additional time for teamwork on the semester project and deliverables.

Here is the semester schedule for 2022. Note that this is a tentative plan that we may adjust during the semester.
