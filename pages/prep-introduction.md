# Introduction and Course Setup

In this week, we get started with teamwork, get an overview of the learning goals in this course, and introduce team-based learning. 


# Read About This Course

For the activities during this week, you need to read through the following pages first on your own:

* [Read about Team-Based Learning](learning-tbl.html)
* [Read about Teamwork Procedures](learning-teamwork.html)
* [Read about Learning Goals](learning-goals.html)
* [Read about Reflection](learning-reflection.html)

As a dry-run, we will do a RAT during the next class. This first one is about the course and does not yet count to the final grade.

# Install Software 

For many aspects of collaboration, we are going to use Microsoft Teams in this course. It has functions for chat as well as sharing and collaborating on files. 

* Visit the [site about Office 365](https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Office+365) and install **Microsoft Teams** on your laptop.
* Install it on your mobile devices (Android or iOS), too.
* You will receive an invitation link to the team _TTM4115 (2020)_ later.

# System Ideas

As part of this course, you will build a system throughout the semester together with the other students in your team. 

### Watch Videos from Previous Years
Have a look at the results from the students of last years. Each team created a video of their system. **Watch *some* of the videos**, to get an impression of the kind of system we look for. 

* [Videos from 2019](videos-2019.html)
* [Videos from 2018](videos-2018.html)
* [Videos from 2017](videos-2017.html)
* [Videos from 2016](https://mediasite.ntnu.no/Mediasite/Catalog/catalogs/ttm4115-studentvideoer-v16) (Requires NTNU login.)

### Three Own Ideas

**Write down three ideas for systems.** These do not have to be mature ideas or well-thought-out, since you will work on them in your teams. However, some raw material in form of initial ideas is important and valuable in that process. 



# All done!

We meet on Monday Jan. 13th, 10:15 in [EL-23](http://bit.ly/2p6mAhe). 


In case you cannot come, please send a short mail to kraemer@ntnu.no. This is important for the teamwork.
