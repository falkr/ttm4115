Aside: The deliveries are aligned with each other, which is why they require less work than you may initially think.


* T1, T2, T3 are **team deliveries** (one delivery per team) and consist of the team activities, and documents about the system you build. Deliveries T1 and T2 are milestones towards T3. This means, you need to deliver them, and they are graded passed/failed. T3 contains elements of T1 and T2, and is the delivery that is graded.
* I1, I2 and I3 are **individual deliveries**. Each student needs to deliver them. I1 and I2 are feedback to the corresponding team deliveries T1 and T2. They are graded passed/failed. I3 is a final reflection document that builds upon all material delivered before, and is graded.
* RATs 1 to 9 are quizzes done during class time. The best 7 of them count. They have an individual component (70%) and a team component (30%). 


## Technical Tips

- You are free to select the most effective tools to create your deliverables. 
    - We recommend to use Microsoft Word for the deliveries.
    - LaTeX is good for scientific articles, but not for these technical documents.
- All delivery documents must be in *PDF* format. 
- You can include diagrams and figures in landscape mode for entire pages. In this case, they need to be readable **from the right**. 
- Check which pattern for the filename we require. This makes file handling for us 10 times faster.
- The header on each page must contain your team number and the delivery name.
- For individual deliveries, your name must be in the header.
