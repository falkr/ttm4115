# Schedule


For each unit, we follow the same schedule:

* You will receive a Blackboard announcement with a link to preparation material. (But even without the announcement, the preparation material is already accessible on this website.)
* We meet on **Mondays at 14:15** in [Realfagbygget Floor U1, room GL-RFB R2](https://link.mazemap.com/MOQ34ith), where we start with the individual RAT and the team RAT, ca 45 minutes.
* We continue with the teamwork for that week.
* On Fridays in the same week between 10:15 and 12:00, different things may happen:
  * You can meet your team independently on campus to finish the teamwork or work on the semester project.
  * We have a question and answer class in [Kjelhuset Floor 1, room GL-KH KJL1](https://link.mazemap.com/8R80onMd) (also digital via Forum and Teams).



The first lecture in 2026 is on **Monday, Jan. 12th, at 14:15**.
