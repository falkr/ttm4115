# Reflection

Reflecting about one's work is helpful for gaining insights and better learning. For system development, reflection contains the ability to manage the team and the processes around it, and is the basis for improvements. In this course, reflection is also an explicit part of the grade. Delivery I3 will include an individual reflection. 

To remind you of reflection and allocate enough time for it, we include two reflections during each unit:

* **Team Reflection:** During the team reflection, you assess how the team works, if you need any improvements and you can schedule follow-ups for the next unit. The team reflection is done at the end of each unit and stored in a single, public document maintained by each team.
* **Individual Reflection:** During the individual reflection,  you get the possibility to reflect about your own role in the team, and your individual learning process. This reflection is stored in an individual document for each student, not visible to other students. To provide feedback, this reflection is also guided by a survey that you need to fill out at the end of each unit.
