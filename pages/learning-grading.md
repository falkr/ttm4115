# Grading


The final grade in the course is based on a portfolio, with the intention to facilitate learning and to provide feedback to students throughout the semester, and enable learning in the context of realistic development conditions through a semester project. The portfolio contains a series of tests, so-called readiness assurance tests (RATs) that are done during class time. Each test introduces the students to a new subset of concepts, as a means to provide feedback on their level of preparation. These tests are multiple-choice and are given, like the preparation material, in English language only. 

To also develop skills and knowledge on higher cognitive levels, the portfolio contains a development project, tightly connected to the content of the RATs, that students conduct throughout the semester in teams. The teams hand in various specification documents about their system common in real projects, and receive feedback on them throughout the semester in various ways, including feedback by peers, student and teaching assistants and the teacher. 

At the end of the semester, each student hands in their individual portfolio, consisting of their team's documents in addition to individual deliveries and reflections that set the team document in context. 
The exact details of the deliveries and requirements are carefully explained at the beginning of the course.
The portfolio is evaluated as a whole according to NTNUs grading scheme. The language for all material is English.


# RATs

Each RAT is a combination of the individual RAT and the team RAT. The individual counts 70% and the team counts 30%. At the end of the semester, we only count the best 7 out of 9 RATs.



# Team Deliveries T1, T2, T3

The team deliveries document your progress with the system. T1 and T2 are not directly graded, but they will be included, in improved form, in your final portfolio.



# Individual Deliveries I1, I2, I3

These are three consecutive deliveries that build on each other, and encourage you to reflect about the course, your own role and progress, and how you reached the learning goals. I2 and I2 are not directly graded, but make it easier for you to write the final portfolio.


# Peer Evaluation

With the delivery of T3 you also deliver a peer review of your teammates. 
This evaluation assigns points to your teammates, and rewards them for good contributions to the teamwork.

This is how it works technically:

- You have 100 points.
- You distribute these 100 points among the other team members. (You don't give points to yourself.)
- In a team with 6 students, this means that you distribute 100 points among the 5 other members.

After the submission, everyone gets a report on the points they have received.

- Everyone can see which points they received, but not from whom.
- The points count towards a score.
- The score is multiplied with the grade for the team project.

# Grading Criteria


## Overall, Generic Criteria

For the entire course, we use the standard [grading scheme for NTNU](https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/Karakterskalaen).

---
type: table
file: files/tables/grading-ntnu.mw

## Specific Criteria

For all deliveries, we will define tables for the criteria, also called [rubrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)).
These criteria give you an orientation about how to reach the learning goals of the course. 
The speficic tables explain how the performance levels and general criteria map to the specific task or learning outcome they cover. The example blow show a rubrics that applies for diagrams in general.

file: files/rubrics/deployment.mw
class: rubric

---

The rows show a number of individual criteria groups, as for instance *Layout*. The individual columns then show what characterizes a layout on different performance levels *excellent*, *good*, *sufficient*. It also describes when a layout is not rateable.


While the criteria from NTNU above are absolute and fixed, we work together in the course of defining criteria for these levels for the different tasks. Part of the deliveries will therefore also be input from you on the criteria.
