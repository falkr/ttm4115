# I3: Final Individual Delivery

The final individual delivery is a report in which you get the opportunity to reflect about 

- your team's system
- deliveries T1 and T2 of your team and your assigned team
- observations you made
- your own learning process and insights
- your contributions to the semester project

**The maximum length is 3 pages.** You can add an appendix that consists of screenshots of material that you can annotate. For instance, you can include a screenshot of a diagram and point out an issue that you refer to in your report.

In this delivery, you should demonstrate in a highly **independent** way how you have gained knowledge from the course. The low-level concepts have already been tested in the RATs, and your skills to build a system are covered partially in the semester project. Here you have to show that you can "connect the dots," and reflect about the course and system development.

Some more hints:

- Deliveries I1 and I2 can help you towards I3. Apart from providing feedback to the other teams, they should also have started a reflection process on your own work and learning process. You can therefore take up points you made in I1 and I2 and develop them. 

- You can take **all teaching material**, including all presentations, articles and the guest lectures as input. You can of course also gather information outside of the provided learning material, if you see need and fit.

- The course addressed three aspects; (1) systems and their architecture, (2) models and languages to reason about them, and (3) processes around people how to create documents and systems. Hence, you can address all of these aspects. 

- Revisit the learning goals of the course. They can be a valuable guide.

- There is no requirement that you cover all aspects, learning goals, or topics addressed in the course. You can therefore select what to focus on. Write what you think is most interesting and most individual to your experience.

- It is important that you write logically, and that you build up some larger arguments. Just listing _"I learned X but I did not learn Y"_ is maybe a reflection, but not a very insightful one. You may therefore need to invest some time to build up arguments and think of them. I1 and I2 have started this process already for some of you. 

- Of course, all material must be written by yourself. Copying from others or letting others copy from you is not allowed. All reflections must be based on your personal experiences in the course. 

- Delivery I3 is not meant as a feedback on the course. For this, please use any of the other channels for course feedback. The focus is your own learning, and reflection about it. Of course, if you develop a point that naturally includes some feedback about the course you may do so.

- The recommended language for I3 is **English**. You can, however, also deliver in Norwegian, if you prefer.
