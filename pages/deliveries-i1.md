# Delivery I1

* This is an individual delivery, each student has to deliver their own solution.
* Focus is on reflection and providing feedback on the delivery of T1.
* This particular delivery I1 is not graded directly, but serves for you as input for I3.


## Input

As input, you use the following:

* The delivery T1 of another team.
* The delivery T1 of your own team.

You will find a list of team assignments on MS Teams, where you can also download the deliveries T1 of that other team.


## Document 1: Providing Feedback for the other Team

In the document, provide feedback to the other team. Structure your feedback according to the following points:

1. Background
2. Vision
3. Objectives
4. Stakeholders
5. Use Case Diagram for Overview
6. Use Cases in Table Form
7. Deployment Diagram
8. **Overall Feedback / Recommendation**

Depending on the delivery, there may be more or less to say about each of the points. 

* Try to be as direct as possible.
* Try to be constructive, i.e., suggest improvements.
* The feedback should not be long --- possibly one or two pages are enough.
* Focus on that the feedback is useful to the team. It should really improve their delivery in this course.
* It's okay to include screenshots (maybe partial ones) that you annotate if that makes things easier. (Then you may need more space than indicated above.)
* **Deliver Document 1 on Blackboard**

## Document 2: Feedback for your own Teams T1

With the impression of reading T1 from another team, have another look at your team's delivery T1. With these "fresh eyes", what can you improve further?

Collect these suggestions for the next time you meet with your team and address them. Eventually, these improvements should find their way into delivery T3.

## Document 3: Individual Reflection

This is a preparation for your individual delivery I3 at the end of the semester. You will probably end up with ca. 1 page of content. You can address everything about the system, the process, the team, the learning goals, your own learning, insights, ... that affects this course.

You don't have to deliver this document. Keep it for your own record. 


* The reflection may be about yourself, your team, the other team you got assigned. (Most likely a combination.)
* You can use a comparison between your team and the other team as a source of starting points to think.
* You may share your feedback and observations with your team so that you can improve your process or system.
