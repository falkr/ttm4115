## Overview

During the semester, you need to hand in the following deliveries: 

---
type: table
file: files/tables/deliveries.mw
---


* T1, T2, T3 are **team deliveries** (one delivery per team) and consist of the team activities, and documents about the system you build. Deliveries T1 and T2 are milestones towards T3. This means, you need to deliver them, and they are graded passed/failed. T3 contains elements of T1 and T2, and is the delivery that is graded.

* I1, I2 and I3 are **individual deliveries**. Each student needs to deliver them. I1 and I2 are feedback to the corresponding team deliveries T1 and T2. They are graded passed/failed. I3 is the final portfolio document that builds upon all material delivered before, and is graded.

* RATs 1 to 9 are quizzes done during class time. The best 7 of them count. They have an individual component (70%) and a team component (30%).

### Final Grading

The final grading is individual and based on the individual portfolio that you hand in at the end. 
This portfolio consists of the elements from T3 (which are based on T1, T2) and a new, individual part that puts T3 into perspective and connects its parts together.
The 7 best RATs are also part of the portfolio.

The grade is given as a whole on the entire portfolio, according to NTNU's grading scale:

## Technical Tips

- You are free to select the most effective tools to create your deliverables. 
    - We recommend to use Microsoft Word for the deliveries.
    - LaTeX is good for scientific articles, but not for these technical documents.
- All delivery documents must be in *PDF* format. 
- You can include diagrams and figures in landscape mode for entire pages. In this case, they need to be readable **from the right**. 
- Check which pattern for the filename we require. This makes file handling for us 10 times faster.
- The header on each page must contain your team number and the delivery name.
- For individual deliveries, your name must be in the header.
