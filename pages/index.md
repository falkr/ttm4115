# Design of Communicating Systems


### Step 1: Onboarding

Please fill out the onboarding scheme so we can register some more information about you.
We will use this for a faster startup and the creation of working teams.

### Step 2: Preparation

Read and work through the [preparation material for setting up the course](prep-setup.html). 


### Step 3: First Class Time

Our first class time will be on **Friday, January 14th 2022**, 12:15 via Zoom. You will find the login details on Blackboard and in the announcement.


# Schedule


For each unit, we follow the same schedule:

* You will receive a Blackboard announcement with a link to preparation material. (But even without the announcement, the preparation material is already accessible on the website.)
* We meet on **Fridays at 12:15** (on Zoom for now), where we start with the individual RAT and the team RAT, ca 45 minutes.
* You continue on Friday with teamwork until at least 16:00, solving the week activities, which are available from the website.
* On **Mondays at 10:15** we meet together on Zoom. (This part of the course will be digital for the entire semester.) In this session, three things happen: 
  1. You can ask questions on the currently ongoing team activity.
  2. I provide sometimes more content on a subject.
  3. We provide some feedback on the team activity from the previous unit.
* In some weeks, you need more time together, especially once we start with the semester project. Here you need to find a time slot where all in your team can meet. 
* The delivery of the week activity has a deadline in the beginning of the next week, so that you still manage to meet together and conclude the week's team activity.

Here is the semester schedule for 2022. Note that this is a tentative plan that we may adjust during the semester.
We start in 2022 fully digitally for the first two weeks and wait for further guidelines how to proceed after that.
