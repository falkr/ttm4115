# Team Setup

* Assign team roles, just like last week.
* Briefly discuss the roles, and consider to change or clarify them. 
* See if you had any improvements or follow-ups from last week, and act on them.


# Modeling and Deployment Diagrams


Today's team activity is about a system to control rice irrigation in Malaysia. For rice to grow, the water levels need to be controlled. Read the following "application story" from Kontron, a manufacturer of embedded computers used for industrial purposes. (This is obviously advertisement for their products, but the system description is at a very good level of detail for this task.)

<a href="https://www.kontron.com/downloads/application_stories/bu-ind/as_abbaco_en.pdf" class="arrow">Adding IoT to Water Works Wonders for Malaysian Rice Growers</a>

Your task will be to create a deployment diagram for this system, based on the information from the story.


### Step 1: Individual Read-Through

Read the application story individually, and pay attention on the technical details, but also on the context of the system. 

- Make notes. 
- Highlight portions of the text that you find relevant. 
- Lookup terms that you don't understand.


:tip: When reading through, you will at some places meet a lot of details, where you may wonder if they are important or not.
In other parts of the description you may see a need for more detailed explanations. 
This is part of the reason why we create the deployment diagram first. 
Think and decide for yourself which details are important at this stage.
If you need to add information or make assumptions, feel free to do so.


### Step 2: Discuss the System

Discuss the system together. Discuss how it works, how it is structured, what its goals are. 


### Step 3: Individual Diagram Sketches

Each on their own, make some sketches **using pen and paper** for a deployment diagram. 

- Don't necessarily try to make the entire diagram yet. 
- Study different alternatives or modeling elements.


### Step 4: Sketch of Diagram 

- Compare your ideas and find commonalities, discuss differences. (Take a photo with your phone and share it.)
- Iteratively agree on a diagram you want to build.
- Outline the diagram, ideally on a whiteboard, blackboard or a shared piece of paper. (Update for 2021: Be practical and inventive how to do that digitally via Teams. There is a digital whiteboard, or you can send photos of your sketches.)


### Step 5: Quality Awareness

Before you start with the final diagram, let's ask: _What makes a **good** deployment diagram?_
Learning to evaluate a diagram is part of the learning process. 
In the end, a diagram is good when it is _useful_. 
Describing this is difficult, but we can at least come up with a list of criteria and points to consider. 

Have a look at the table below, which is also called a [rubric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)).
It lists criteria in different categories, which should help as a framework to understand the quality of a diagram.

* Some tips for [strategic layout](unit-modeling-diagram-tips.html#have-a-strategic-layout).
* Some tips for [tidy graphics](unit-modeling-diagram-tips.html#tidying-up-the-graphics).
* [Syntax for deployment diagrams](prep-modeling.html#deployment-diagrams) from the preparation.
* Getting the level of detail right may require the most judgement. Think which information is useful to the reader of your diagram, and which information rather clutters it up.


### Step 6: The Final Diagram 

Based on the previous step, create a polished diagram. For this time, we recommend you to try the tool [Draw.io](draw.io), because it offers to collaborate simultaneously. You can either work on a single machine with a shared screen or projector, or you can all log into the same shared diagram and work on your laptops. 

- Try to create a diagram that provides you with a good overview of the system.
- Include _relevant_ details.
- Try to build a good layout. Have several attempts, the first one may not be the best one.

### Step 7: Self-Evaluation

On Teams find the template for the self-evaluation document `Files > Unit 1... > Rice Farming Team XX.docx`. Fill out the text for the criteria of the rubrics, and any other concerns not covered by the rubrics. (If you immediately come up with improvements, go back and change your diagram!)

Copy the diagram into the document. 

:delivery: Deliver the docx document including your self-evaluation and diagram, and deliver it on Teams with the filename `Rice Farming Team XX.docx`. Store it under `Files > Unit 1... > Diagrams`.



# Peer Review of Diagrams

Now you ask another team for their diagram and self-evaluation. This requires some coordination, so that each team gets another diagram to comment on, and all diagrams are commented.

* We don't do the assignment beforehand since not all of you may be ready at the same time.
* We can't simply use pairs of teams for all (like Team 1 and Team 2 reviewing each other's diagrams) since we have an odd number of teams. 
* Check in the document Coordination.docx on Teams and note there on which team you comment.
* Check with the student assistants.



, since you have scheduled different time slots. Have a look in the team overview diagram which teams may already be ready, and contact them on Teams. 


Have a look at the diagram of the other team. We recommend to do this on the original online version. (Ask them for sharing access or duplicating the diagram). Add notes into their diagram, using UML comments.

Use **red** for errors, **green** for general comments or recommendations, **yellow** for ambiguous cases.

Include your commented diagram in a copy of the original document.


:delivery: Deliver your comments on Teams with the filename `Rice Farming Team XX comments by Team YY.docx`. Store it under `Files > Unit 1... > Diagrams with Comments`.




# Team Reflection for This Unit 

* Add another section to the team reflection document, just like last week.
* How did the roles work today? 


# Individual Reflection

* Fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cgahCS-CZ0SluluzdZZ8BSxiepoCd7lKk70IThBWqdJUQUQxNEVLOTBZMDZGNkJBM1Y2NjZCTzhWSi4u" class="arrow">individual reflection survey</a>.
* Copy the answers into a document that you maintain on your own.
* Add any additional observations to your reflection diary.
