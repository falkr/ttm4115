## Question 1

:rat:Ideally, we want to have a system...

1. With high modularity, high cohesion and high coupling.
2. With low modularity, high cohesion and low coupling.
3. With high modularity, low cohesion and low coupling.
4. With high modularity, high cohesion and low coupling.

## Question 2

:rat:What is the difference between component cohesion and component coupling?

1. Coupling looks inside a component, cohesion at the entire system.
2. Cohesion mostly looks inside a component, coupling between one or more components.
3. More coupling is better than more cohesion.
4. Cohesion is a system property, coupling looks at pairs of components.

## Question 3

:rat:How do components map to use cases?

1. One use case, in general, invokes several components.
2. One component, in general, matches one use case.
3. Ideally, a component should focus on a single use case only.
4. Several use cases are needed to describe a single component.

## Question 4

:rat:Which statement about objects and components is true?

1. A component can be programmed using objects and classes, but is not the same.
2. Compoments are like classes.
3. Components have nothing to do with classes or objects.
4. Most object-oriented languages have special constructs for components built in.

## Question 5

:rat:Services are to components...

1. What objects are to classes.
2. What interfaces are to classes.
3. What classes are to interfaces.
4. What classes are to objects.

## Question 6

:rat:When we say that components offer a unit of abstraction, we mean:

1. To structure functions into suitable components.
2. To model the components in a system as modules.
3. To outsource the programming for a specific component.
4. To structure the system into parts that can be understood and analyzed separately from each other.

## Question 7

:rat:Which definition fits best for "component-based software engineering" ?

1. It is an approach for structuring functions into components and defining the interfaces between them.
2. It is an approach to implement and test the components in a system.
3. It is an approach to define, implement and compose loosely coupled components into systems.
4. It is an approach for programming the components in a modular system

## Question 8

:rat:Which three claims about modularity are CORRECT?

1. 2), 3) and 4)
2. 2), 4) and 5)
3. 1), 2) and 3)
4. 1), 3) and 5)



1. By structuring functions into suitable components,
it is easier to understand the system.
2. Components help to structure the system into parts that can be understood and analyzed separately from each other.
3. Components represent a possible containment border for errors.
4. Functions structured into components are easy to reuse.
5. When making changes to system, a component can be analyzed in isoloation.
