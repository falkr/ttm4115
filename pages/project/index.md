# System Specification

During the semester you will work on a system specification in your development teams. 
This work is the basis for the entire course, and it will be delivered in several versions so you get feedback on it also during the semester.

# Format and Template 


- All delivery documents must be in *PDF* format. 
- You can include diagrams and figures in landscape mode for entire pages. In this case, they need to be readable **from the right**. 
- Check which pattern for the filename we require. This makes file handling for us faster.
- The header on each page must contain your team number and the delivery name.
- For individual deliveries, your name must be in the header.
