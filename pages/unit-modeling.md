# Team Setup

* Assign team roles, just like last week. 
* See if you had any improvements or follow-ups from last week, and act on them.






# Modeling and Deployment Diagrams


Today's team activity is about a system to control rice irrigation in Malaysia. For rice to grow, the water levels need to be controlled. Read the following "application story" from Kontron, a manufacturer of embedded computers used for industrial purposes. (This is obviously advertisement for their products, but the system description is at a very good level of detail for this task.)

<a href="https://www.kontron.com/downloads/application_stories/bu-ind/as_abbaco_en.pdf" class="arrow">Adding IoT to Water Works Wonders for Malaysian Rice Growers</a>

Your task will be to create a deployment diagram for this system, based on the information from the story. If you need to add information or make assumptions, feel free to do so.


### Step 1: Individual Read-Through

Read the application story individually, and pay attention on the technical details, but also on the context of the system. 

- Make notes. 
- Highlight portions of the text that you find relevant. 
- Lookup terms that you don't understand.

### Step 2: Discuss the System

Discuss the system together. Discuss how it works, how it is structured, what its goals are. 

### Step 3: Individual Diagram Sketches

Each on their own, make some sketches **using pen and paper** for a deployment diagram. 

- Don't necessarily try to make the entire diagram yet. 
- Study different alternatives or modeling elements.

### Step 4: Sketch of Diagram 

- Compare your ideas and find commonalities, discuss differences. 
- Iteratively agree on a diagram you want to build.
- Outline the diagram, ideally on a whiteboard, blackboard or a shared piece of paper. 

### Step 5: Diagram 

Based on the previous step, create a polished diagram. For this time, we recommend you to try the tool **Draw.io**, because it offers to collaborate simultaneously. You can either work on a single machine with a shared screen or projector, or you can all log into the same shared diagram and work on your laptops. 

- Try to create a diagram that provides you with a good overview of the system.
- Include _relevant_ details.
- Try to build a good layout. Have several attempts, the first one may not be the best one.

Deliver the diagram on Blackboard immediately.


# Peer Review of Diagrams

Ask another team for their diagram. This may require some coordination, since you have scheduled different timeslots. Have a look in the team overview diagram which teams may already be ready, and contact them on Teams. 

* Use the channel **Exchange** on Teams.
* In the Exchange channel, find a document called _Unit 1 - Deployment Diagrams Exchange.docx_ where you list which team you review.

Have a look at the diagram of the other team. Add notes into their diagram (ask them for access to the document.) Comments by adding UML note elements:

---
type: figure

---

Use **red** for errors, **green** for general comments or recommendations, **yellow** for ambiguous cases.

Deliver this other team's diagram with your comments as PDF on Blackboard, and notify the other team so that they are aware of your comments. 





# Team Reflection for This Unit 

* Add another section to the team reflection document, just like last week. 

# Individual Reflection

* Fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cgahCS-CZ0SluluzdZZ8BSxiepoCd7lKk70IThBWqdJUQUQxNEVLOTBZMDZGNkJBM1Y2NjZCTzhWSi4u" class="arrow">individual reflection survey</a>.
* Copy the answers into a document that you maintain on your own.
* Add any additional observations to your reflection diary.
