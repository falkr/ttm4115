# Delivery I2

* This is an individual delivery, each student has to deliver their own solution.
* Focus is on reflection and providing feedback on the delivery of T2.
* This particular delivery I2 is not graded directly, but serves for you as input for I3.
* The delivery consists of **two separate documents.**


### Input

As input, you use the following:

* The delivery T2 of another team.
* The delivery T2 of your own team.

You will find a list of team assignments on Blackboard, where you can also download the deliveries T2 of that other team.


### Content

* **Document 1: Feedback to the other team.** This document will be made available to the other team.
* **Document 2: Reflection and insights for own team.** This document will remain private.

### Document 1: Providing Feedback

In the document, provide feedback to the other team. Structure your feedback according to the following points:

1. Feedback on the updated deployment diagram
2. Feedback on the sequence diagrams
3. Feedback on the state machines
4. Overall Feedback / Recommendation


**Some hints for Sequence diagrams:** Check for syntax problems, check for important implied scenarios, check generally for situations that require clarification or improvements. Also, check if the sequence diagrams fit to the problem. For instance, when there are only a few interactions, or interactions are very coarse and high-level, re-visit the problem the system should solve and check if more and more detailed sequence diagrams would fit better.

**Some hints for State Machines:** Check for syntax problems. Check that events are handled in all states as necessary, check that timers are used consistently. Check that the scenarios described by the sequence diagram are actually handled by the state machine. Check if the state machine can be made more robust against errors.
Also, check if the state machine diagrams fit to the problem. For instance, when there are only a few states and transitions, re-visit the problem the system should solve and check if more and more detailed state machine would fit better.



Depending on the delivery, there may be more or less to say about each of the points. 

* Try to be as direct as possible.
* Try to be constructive, i.e., suggest improvements.
* The feedback should not be long --- possibly one or two pages are enough.
* Focus on that the feedback is useful to the team. It should really improve their delivery in this course.
* It's okay to include screenshots (maybe partial ones) that you annotate if that makes things easier. (Then you may need more space than indicated above.)
* Note that the feedback you give is not anonymous. This is on purpose, so a team might ask you for clarifications (though this is probably not necessary).


### Document 2: Reflection

This is a preparation for your individual delivery I3 at the end of the semester. You will probably end up with ca. 1 page of content. You can address everything about the system, the process, the team, the learning goals, your own learning, insights, ... that affects this course. 

* The reflection may be about yourself, your team, the other team you got assigned. (Most likely a combination.)
* You can use a comparison between your team and the other team as a source of starting points to think.
* You may share your feedback and observations with your team so that you can improve your process or system.
