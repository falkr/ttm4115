# Unit 2: Modeling and Deployment Diagrams

In the following unit, we will first look at the task of **modeling in general**. In the second part, we will learn the first diagram type: **deployment diagrams**. They are perfect for getting an overview of the parts of the system, which software runs on them and how they communicate. 


## Learning Goals

:goals: The learning goals specific for this week are the following:

- Be aware of the overall importance of modeling in engineering.
- Understand what constitutes a model.
- Recite different properties of models.
- Create deployment diagrams.
- Decide which elements of a deployment diagram are relevant and chose a suitable level of detail.


### For the Semester Project

In the semester project you will provide a systems specification, which is a model, and most of your effort lies in the activity of modelling. 
You will often need to decide which information to include, and what makes a good model. 

The second part of this unit about deployment diagrams is also directly relevant as you need to provide several iterations of your system as a deployment diagram.
