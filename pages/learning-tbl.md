# Team-Based Learning


The course will use team-based learning (TBL). 
This is a learning method to ensure active learning in small teams. 
It will make this course intensive, but also the source of much fun. 
By the end of the semester, most students prefer TBL to traditional lectures.

Some features of team-based and active learning:

* You will be part of a team of 5 to 7 students that stays constant during the semester.
* You will receive a preparation guide that will help you to prepare for a lecture, for instance by reading a book chapter, doing a specific exercise or watching a video.
* We will do several readiness assurance tests (RATs). These are multiple-choice tests that are easy to solve when you are reasonably prepared. They also count towards the final grade.
* The team will help during the RAT, and this also counts towards the final grade.

## How TBL Works

The course consists of separate units, roughly one for each week. Each week will be organized in a very similar way:

1. You need to prepare for the unit. 
2. At class time (every Monday 8:15) we start with a test about the reading material, a so-called RAT.
3. After the RAT, you get special activities that you do together in your team. Depending on the activities, there are different ways of handing in the results. 
 
## Phase 1: Preparation

The preparation happens individually. Sometimes it is one or two chapters of a book, special reading material developed for this course or some videos.
This gives you the opportunity to study at your own pace and get familiar with a new topic.
Of course it will vary how much time each student will spend on the preparation material, and it also depends on the unit, but roughly 2 hours is a good guideline, sometimes more and sometimes less. 



## Phase 2: Individual RAT

A RAT is a multiple-choice test with 10 questions that have 4 answer alternatives.
You get 20 minutes to answer the test individually.
The questions are not particularly difficult, and directly related to the preparation material. 
Some questions may still feel a bit tricky, since we want you to select the _best_ answer.

Since the RAT counts towards the final exam, it will be conducted under strict exam conditions.

Before the RAT:

* Meet up on time for class. The RAT will start at 8:15.
* Sit at the assigned places.
* No helping material is allowed.
* Your mobile phone must be in flight mode, stowed away in your bag.
* All bags must be placed front of the auditorium.
* During the first part of the RAT, talking is not allowed.

During the RAT:

* Check that you received the correct RAT, with your name on top.
* Fill out the answering form at the top of the RAT.
* Calculate the checksum once you are finished.
* Wait silently until we collect the RATs.
* Do not cheat or help others to cheat.

## Phase 3: Team RAT

After the first 20 minutes with the individual RAT, you get the same test again, but this time you solve it in your team.
At the beginning, get the team-RAT, and find the assigned place in the auditorium for your team.
Together with your team-RAT you receive an attached scratch card.
You need to discuss with your team members and agree on a common answer.
Once you agree on an answer, you scratch the corresponding field on the scratch card open. 
If the answer was correct, you'll see a little star in it. 
In this case, proceed with the next question.
If you don't see a star, find the next answer alternative, until you find it.

For best learning, make sure of the following:

* Everybody should contribute and be heard in the discussion.
* Solve the question one by one, and scratch immediately after you have discussed a question. (That means, don't scratch all questions at once at the end.)
* Switch at least each week who scratches.

The team results also counts towards your final grade, so it is not allowed to talk to other teams, or use any helping materials. 

* Do not talk to other teams.
* Once you finish or the time is up, deliver your scratch card and the RAT at the blackboard. 
* If you finish early, you may leave the auditorium.

At the end of the RAT we give you an overview of the results, and discuss selected answers in class. 
You will also receive an email that lists your results. 

## Phase 4: Mini-Lectures

Depending on the content of the unit, the results from the RAT there is now the time for what resembles a traditional lecture, but much shorter, which is why we call it **mini-lecture**. Here you get also the possibility to ask further questions about the preparation material. 


## Phase 5: Team Activities

After the team-RAT (and a coffee break) we continue with the team activities for this learning unit. 
Since we have only 2 hours of class time scheduled, 
we will use the time only to introduce the activities and clarify any questions about the task, 
the expectations, and how you deliver your results. 

After the class time you can either continue working in your team or schedule a time
when all are available. The team activities are timed to fit in an 2-hour block. 
You finish each team activity with a delivery and also a team reflection.
Depending on the type of activity and delivery, you'll get some feedback on it in the next week.

Aside: Apart from the team activities that are scheduled each week, you will also work on a semester project. These result in the deliveries T1, T2, T3, but you are more free to schedule your time.




## Questions and Answers

**Does this mean I need to meet up physically on campus?**
Yes. TBL requires you to meet up for the RATs and the team activities. 

**What if I am sick or have other reasons for not showing up?**
We only count the best 6 out of 8 (7 out of 9) RATs. 
This means, you can miss two RATs without that it has any direct effect on your grade. 
I recommend that you tell me as quickly as possible once you know that you cannot meet up. 
In some situations we can allow to write a RAT at a later time, but this is an exception.

**Can I switch teams?**
In principle, no. Teams are assigned so that they are constructed diversely and evenly.

### On Forming Teams


In TBL, teams are assigned by the instructor. Let's hear the description from Michael Sweet why this is a good idea:
