# Theme for 2024: Electrical Car Charging

There are more and more electrical cars, and subsequently more charging stations. The charging process involves quite complex interactions between the car, the charging station, and the app for starting the process and payment.

You should create a system for managing the charging. You should program components for the car, the app, and the charging station. Depending on your ideas, you may also add more components. 

You will receive two Raspberry Pi computers, one of them with a [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/sense-hat.html). With these you could simulate for instance the charging station.

Feel free to discuss the outline of the semester project on the discussion forum, we will refine the guidelines as we learn more together.


Apart from being related to car charging, you have a lot of freedom. 
Ideally, beside the basic functionality of managing the charing process, think of the following:

* Should it be a car charger for a single car in a home, or for several cars in a public car charing station. (The latter will probably enable more interactions.)
* How do you make the user interface responsive so that the user knows what is going on, given that all components may fail?
* Do you want to implement new features like reservations, queuing, guaranteed power, or other ideas that require more advanced management?
