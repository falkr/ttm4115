# Team Forming

## Step 1: Find a Team Name

Your team ID corresponds to the table you are assigned to, i.e., 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21. In addition, find a name that you like. 

Also: Find a Team Emoji. Because 2018 üê∑.

## Step 2: Take a Picture

Take a picture of the entire team. Add annotations on the picture to show everyone's name. 

## Step 3: 

Upload the picture on Padlet. Add Team ID and the new team name!

# Modeling and Deployment Diagrams


Today's team activity is about a system to control rice irrigation in Malaysia. For rice to grow, the water levels need to be controlled. Read the following "application story" from Kontron, a manufacturer of embedded computers used for industrial purposes. (This is obviously advertisement for their products, but the system description is at a very good level of detail for this task.)

[Adding IoT to Water Works Wonders for Malaysian Rice Growers](https://www.kontron.com/downloads/application_stories/bu-ind/as_abbaco_en.pdf)

Your task will be to create a deployment diagram for this system, based on the information from the story. If you need to add information or make assumptions, feel free to do so.

**For the course grade:** This diagram will be part of the delivery T1. In addition, you will create a deployment diagram of your own system that is also part of T1.


## Setup

Assign the following roles for today:

* **Timekeeper:** Responsible to keep the time on all steps, coordinate time plans, punctual delivery of all items.
* **Delivery:** Responsible to check that all deliveries are properly stored. (Padlet, with other teams, in shared folder, backup, etc...)
* **Moderator:** Coordinate discussion
* assign more roles as you see need 
* please also make sure tables and whiteboards are clean after you leave

## Step 1: Individual Read-Through

Read the application story individually, and pay attention on the technical details, but also on the context of the system. Make notes.

## Step 2: Individual Diagram Sketches

Make some sketches (on paper) individually with elements from the diagram. Don't yet try to make the entire diagram. Study different alternatives or modeling elements.

## Step 3: Team Work on Iteration 1

Using the whiteboard, compare your ideas and find commonalities, discuss differences. Iteratively agree on a diagram you want to build. 

## Step 4: Final Diagram in Draw.io 

Based on Step 3, create a polished diagram in Draw.io. Save it in Google Docs for easy sharing.

**Time keepers: This diagram needs to be finished by the time agreed in class, on the blackboard!**

## Step 5: Peer Review

Exchange sharing links with another team (listed below) for review. You need to grant editing rights (not only commenting.)

Comments by adding UML note elements:

Use **red** for errors, **green** for general comments or recommendations, **yellow** for ambiguous cases.

Note that we review circularly, i.e., not in pairs of teams, since we are an odd number of teams:

* Team **7** reviews the diagram of Team **10**.
* Team **8** reviews the diagram of Team **11**.
* Team **9** reviews the diagram of Team **12**.
* Team **10** reviews the diagram of Team **13**.
* Team **11** reviews the diagram of Team **14**.
* Team **12** reviews the diagram of Team **15**.
* Team **13** reviews the diagram of Team **16**.
* Team **14** reviews the diagram of Team **17**.
* Team **15** reviews the diagram of Team **18**.
* Team **16** reviews the diagram of Team **21**.
* Team **17** reviews the diagram of Team **7**.
* Team **18** reviews the diagram of Team **8**.
* Team **21** reviews the diagram of Team **9**.


## Step 6: Final Diagram

Based on the feedback you received, prepare a final diagram. Make sure that the layout is readable and decent, that the UML syntax is correct, and that the diagram "works", in the sense that it conveys the important information about the system in a suitable way.

**Store the Diagram as a PDF (available to all team members.) 

Store a copy on Padlet:

# Team Conventions

Browse through the suggestions for teamwork from the last session (on the Teams Padlet). Discuss which conventions you want to have in your team. Be specific. Write them down in a document, and share this document. (For instance in a shared Drive folder.) This document is also part of your final delivery. You should review it whenever you see fit.
