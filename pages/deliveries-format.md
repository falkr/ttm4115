# Formatting Rules for Deliveries

* Start each section on a new page. 
* Make sure to include team name on each page, in the header or footer of the document.
* Filename: **ttm4115-2018-XX-team-YY.pdf**, where XX is the delivery, like `T1` and YY is your team number, for instance 01 or 13. Consistent file name makes it much easier for us to process all deliveries!
* Diagrams can be included in landscape format, but must be readable from the right. (That means, they must be readable when the page is turned 90 degrees clockwise.
