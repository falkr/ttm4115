# Unit 2: Modeling and Deployment Diagrams

In the following unit, we will first look at the task of **modeling in general**. In the second part, we will learn the first diagram type: **deployment diagrams**. They are perfect for getting an overview of the parts of the system, which software runs on them and how they communicate. 


## Learning Goals

:goals: The learning goals specific for this week are the following:

- Be aware of the overall importance of modeling in engineering.
- Understand what constitutes a model.
- Recite different properties of models.
- Create deployment diagrams.
- Decide which elements of a deployment diagram are relevant and chose a suitable level of detail.


### For the Semester Project

In the semester project you will provide a systems specification, which is a model, and most of your effort lies in the activity of modelling. 
You will often need to decide which information to include, and what makes a good model. 

The second part of this unit about deployment diagrams is also directly relevant as you need to provide several iterations of your system as a deployment diagram.

### For the Semester Project

When we start with requirements engineering, we will ask you to create the requirements for the semester project. [Have a look at the theme for the semester project of this year](../project/index.html), so that you can start early with preparing some specific ideas for your project.

# Heads-up for Unit 4

In [Unit 4](../unit-4-req/index.html) we work on requirements, and as preparation you need to read two book chapters. Some students want to get more time for reading, so we notify you about this already now.
