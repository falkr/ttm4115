# Introduction and Course Setup

In this week, we get started with teamwork, get an overview of the learning goals in this course, and introduce team-based learning. 


For the activities during this week, you need to read through the following pages first on your own:

* [Read about Team-Based Learning](learning-tbl.html)
* [Read about Teamwork Procedures](learning-teamwork.html)
* [Read about Learning Goals](learning-goals.html)
* [Read about Reflection](learning-reflection.html)

As a dry-run, we will do a RAT during the next class.
