# State Machines in Python


## Task 1: Traffic Light

* Look at the provided code of the traffic light, and run it. 
* Create a state machine diagram from it. (Reverse-engineering)
* Create a copy of the diagram, but use more entry and exit actions on states.
* Create another implementation of the traffic light state machine (in another cell) and run it.

**Time for a break?**

## Task 2: Kitchen Timer

* Use the code provided for the simple use interface of the kitchen timer.
* Get the state machine diagram you built previously, and create it in STMPY.
* Run the state machine and validate if you are satisfied with how it works.

**Time for a break?**

## Task 3: Car Lock

From scratch, create a simple user interface (even only buttons and text fields is enough) to validate the car lock controller you built previously.
