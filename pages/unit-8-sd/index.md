# Unit 8: Interactions

State machines are suitable to show the behavior of a single component
at a time, and define its behavior in terms of states and transitions.
We have also seen that state machines are used to define a protocol, as
for instance TCP, by showing the behavior of each of the communication
partners. Sequence diagrams, on the other hand, are used to specify the
interactions between the components of a system. Interactions can happen
through method-, function- or operation-calls, or via signals. Sequence
diagrams specify therefore behavior by looking at the sequences of
interactions *between* several components. These components can be
within the same computer or far away from each other. Some of the
components may not even be software.


## Learning Goals

:goals: After this week, you will be able to:

- Create syntactically valid sequence diagrams.
- Validate sequence diagrams.
- Reason about design choices using sequence diagrams.
- Compare sequence diagrams based on their trace semantics.
- Find and resolve implied scenarios.

### For the Semester Project

You'll need sequence diagrams to develop the interactions between the components.
