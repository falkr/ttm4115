<p>Then, the rest of that sentence is just a list of stuff you could maybe possibly
use the pattern for. Not very illuminating unless your use case happens to be in
that list. <em>My</em> pithy tagline for the Command pattern is:</p>
<p><strong>A command is a <em><span name="latin">reified</span> method call</em>.</strong></p>
<aside name="latin"><p>Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting users parameterize clients

<p>Command is one of my favorite patterns. Most large programs I write, games or
otherwise, end up using it somewhere. When I&#8217;ve used it in the right place, it&#8217;s
neatly untangled some really gnarly code. For such a swell pattern, the Gang of
Four has a predictably abstruse description:</p>

<blockquote>

with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable
operations.</p>
