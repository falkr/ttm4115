# Requirements and Design Thinking


Before we actually start to build a system **right**, we need to ensure that we actually build the **right system**. 
This is part of systems development is called **requirements engineering**.


## Learning Goals



Goals: The learning goals specific for this week are the following:

- Understand how critical requirements are for the development process.
- Go through a design thinking workshop to elaborate requirements.
- Write a Vision and Scope document.


## Preparation

Read carefully through the following book chapter from the compendium:

* Software Requirements, Third Edition Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty, 2013, Microsoft Press. 
**Chapter 1: The Essential Software Requirement.** pp 3--23 (20 pages). 
This is a classic book on requirements, and this first chapter introduces all terms and illustrates them nicely.

In addition, read through the following chapter from the compendium:

* Software Requirements, Third Edition Karl Wiegers and Joy Beatty, 2013, Microsoft Press.  
**Appendix C: Sample Requirements Document.** pp 575--580 (6 pages).
This is a sample requirements document, similar to one that you also will have to deliver for your project. 
The RAT will not contain question that require you to remember details from the document, but this document provides a valuable context for Chapter 1.

Aside: You find the book chapter as part of the compendium on Blackboard, under _Learning Materials_.


## System Ideas

You have already thought about ideas for your system last week, and then you have discussed with the other team members. 
Have another iteration on this process. 
Try to develop --- on your own, for now --- some of the ideas that you may have heard from the others, or new ideas you may have come up with.
Make some notes that you present to your team during the team activity.



## Optional Preparation

During the team activities, we will use the Tiles Toolkit developed at NTNU for a design workshop for the system. 
If you want, read about the toolkit already now.
