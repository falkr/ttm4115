# Unit 6: Agile Development


So far, we haven't spent a lot of time to talk about our development process. We have spent most effort into: 

* understanding how to figure out the user requirements so that we built the right system
* understanding the intricacies with communication and interactions
* the documentation of system architecture
* the specification of use cases

In the second part of the course, we will also learn how to describe:

* the detailed specification of interactions with sequence diagrams
* the detailed specification of component behavior using state machines
* and finally how to code state machines
