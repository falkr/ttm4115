# Expectations

Part of a succesfull collaboration is that everyone is aware of the expectations everyone has.

# What I Expect From You:

* For this course to work, it's important that you **do the preparation** before each unit. Reserve enough time for them during the week; having this course is 25% of your main job.
* Meet up
* I expect that you **have a critical, but constructive attitude.** Some activities, material and tools will be new, and I can't guarantee that everything works without any flaw. When that happens, tell me and the teaching assistants, and we'll make it work together.
* Work focused and efficient. Rather take a break when you need it
* When something's missing, tell!



# What You Can Expect From Me:

* The goal of my work is to provide a good learning environment to you. My time is limited (so is yours)
