# Schedule


For each unit, we follow the same schedule:

* You will receive a Blackboard announcement with a link to preparation material. (But even without the announcement, the preparation material is already accessible on this website.)
* We meet on **Mondays at 12:15** in [Landm√•lerhallen](https://link.mazemap.com/oOca9g4M), where we start with the individual RAT and the team RAT, ca 45 minutes.
* We continue with the teamwork for that week.
* On Tuesdays between 12:15 and 14:00, different things may happen:
  * You can meet you team independently on campus to finish the teamwork or work on the semester project.
  * We have a (digital) question and answer class.


The first lecture in 2024 is on **Monday, Jan. 15th at 12:15**.
