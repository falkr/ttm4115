# Grading

There is no final written exam in the course. 
Your final grade for this course will consist of three components:

* A semester project, done in teams (40%). There are several deliveries throughout the semester.
* Readiness assurance tests (30%). These are several multiple-choice tests that cover the reading material. The RATs are carried out throughout the semester.
* Individual deliveries (30%). There are several deliveries throughout the semester.

# RATs

Each RAT is a combination of the individual RAT and the team RAT. The individual counts 70% and the team counts 30%. At the end of the semester, we only count the best 7 out of 9 RATs. 


# Team Deliveries T1, T2, T3

The team deliveries document your progress with the system. T1 and T2 are not directly graded, but you receive feedback to them and base the final team delivery T3 on many of the elements of T1 and T2. 

# Peer Evaluation

Three times during the semester, at the same time as the individual deliveries I1, I2, I3, you also deliver a peer evaluation.
This evaluation assigns points to your teammates, and rewards them for good contributions to the teamwork.

This is how it works technically:

- You have 100 points.
- You distribute these 100 points among the other team members. (You don't give points to yourself.)
- In a team with 6 students, this means that you distribute 100 points among the 5 other members.

After the submission, everyone gets a report on the points they have received.

- Everyone can see which points they received, but not from whom.
- The points count towards a score.
- The score is multiplied with the grade for the team project.

### Examples

- A student thinks that all member of the team contributed equally. There were 6 students in the team, so each of the 5 other students gets 20 points.
- In a team where all members have contributed equally, they ideally all receive 100 points, which results in a score of 100%, so that it has no effect on the grade.
- A student thinks that not all team members contributed equally, and therefore gives the following points: 20, 21, 17, 19, 23.


### Experience

We have done peer review since 2016, and each year the reference group recommends to continue with peer review.

The majority of the scores that result from the peer review are located in a narrow intervall around 100, which means that the effect on the final grade is very little.

It seems that the peer review has a positive effect on the attention in the team to contribute.

### Extra Rules

* Peer review is not a means to resolve conflicts in a team. These should be resolved directly, maybe by seeking help. 
* Teams need to be functional for the peer review to work. A teammate not meeting up regularly, for instance, cannot submit a peer review. Teams that effectively only consist of 4 students are not a good basis for a valid peer review.
* The course responsible _can_, but has not obligation to, reject a peer review.
* If no peer review is submitted by a student, it counts as if all points are equally distributed among the other team members.

We will also discuss rules in class.

# Individual Deliveries I1, I2, I3

These are three consecutive deliveries that build on each other, and encourage you to reflect about the course, your own role and progress, and how you reached the learning goals. I2 and I2 are not directly graded, but make it easier for you to write the final individual delivery I3.
