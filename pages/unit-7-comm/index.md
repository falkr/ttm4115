# Unit 7: Communication

In this unit, we will have a look at communication at the level of an application. 
This means, we will learn how communication protocols influence our application logic. 
We will also study some of the details of specific protocols, in particular HTTP and MQTT.

## Learning Goals

:goals: The learning goals specific for this week are the following:

- Recognize and recite basic communication patterns and terminology.
- Relate communication mechanisms to each other.
- Select proper communication patterns and topologies for a given problem.
- Reciting the basic mechanisms of HTTP and MQTT.
- Designing an MQTT topic structure for a given system.


### For the Semester Project

Your semester project will require a high degree of communication between the components, and you should use HTTP and MQTT for that as introduced in the following.
