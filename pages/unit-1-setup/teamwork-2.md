# Balances in Teamwork

Ideally, your team works in a balanced way. Below with examples for balances you should be aware of:

* **Level of Talking:** Is there too much talking going on? Are there some persons that talk all the time, while others say almost nothing? 
* **Level of Focus:** Are you working focused enough so that you reach your goal?
* **Attitudes: Critical vs. Naïve:** Does your team just blindly accept any contribution, or do you dare to challenge each other's ideas in a constructive way?

These are just examples of balances. 

* Find the document **General/Unit01.../Balances in Teamwork Team XX.pptx** and make a copy.
* Go through each page, and fill out the table.
* Discuss guidelines for working with each other.
* Conclude on the last page with expectations that you have towards each other.

Copy the PPTX with your final answer into your team's channel / Unit01 (folder for this unit).
Done!




# Team Reflection for This Unit 

It may seem like an overhead to reflect already now during the setup and with these relatively simple tasks. But this team reflection should become a routine from now on. Fill out the section for today's week:

### Roles

Reflect about the following points:

* How did you assign roles today?
* Are the roles clear? Do you need to change them?

### Improvements

Reflect about the following points:

* Is there anything that you can do to improve the way you work?
* What are things you want to observe or follow up on next week?
* Did you actually improve things you noted last time? (This is the first time today.)


### Today's Performance

Reflect about the following points:

* Did you reach the goals?
* What could be improved? 

:aside: This team reflection should become a natural routine for each week.
