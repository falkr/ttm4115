# Semester Project

## Requirements for the System

We let you choose what your system should do, because we really want you to work on your own ideas. However, one of the goals with the semester project is to apply the learning goals of the course. Therefore, there are some rules that any system must fulfil. These rules will help you, so that you can prepare good deliverables for your project and achieve a good score. If you have doubts if your system complies with these rules, or you have reasons for ignoring any of the rules, contact us!

* The system must be distributed and consist of <mark>several different parts</mark>, which execute on more than two computing nodes. A mobile app to play Tic Tac Toe is not a good system for this course.
* <mark>Communication must be an essential part of the functionality</mark>, i.e., it must be critical for the system to fulfil its purpose.
* There should be <mark>event-driven, stateful behavior</mark>, and there should be a certain complexity to the solution. A door bell only with a button and a speaker would be distributed and involve communication, but is obviously too simple. However, many systems that offer some apparently simple functionality may require more complex interactions to make them work reliably and securely. So a very special door bell may be a good idea after all. This means you should not discard simple ideas before you have evaluated how they could be realized.
