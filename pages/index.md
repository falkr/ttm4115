# Design of Communicating Systems

**The Update to the year 2025 is still under progress. At least the [Schedule](https://ttm4115.iik.ntnu.no/schedule.html), however, is already adapted.**


**Developing systems is surprisingly hard.** 
We often think that the programming is the difficult part,
but most of the important decisions that affect the system's quality are done long before the first line of code is written, or, at least, these decisions *should be done before*. 
In this course, you will get some of the tools and experiences that will help you to become a better engineer and adopt a more realistic approach to systems development in team. 
It's also fun, but we leave it up to you to decide.

Welcome to the iteration in spring {{:year:}}!


## Startup for {{:year:}}


### Step 1: Onboarding
