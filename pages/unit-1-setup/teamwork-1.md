# Team Setup


### Introduction Round

Have an introduction round. To make it more fun, start with one student that interviews another one, then move to the next student, so that each one gets interviewed and each one poses the questions once. 

You can ask the following:

* Where are you from?
* Which study program do you attend?
* What did you have for breakfast?

(Or anything else you want to know.)

:aside: It's a good idea to use a timer in this exercise, for example the one you have on your phone. Use max. 5 minutes for each one in your team.


# Team Reflection Document

### Find Your Teams Channel

In the Team for the course, there is a **public** channel for your Team (called *Team XX*, so for instance *Team 01* for Team 01). It is public so other can send you files and messages, we need that later in the course.

Store all your documents in the 'Shared' section of your team's channel. For **each unit, you first need to create a folder, for example Unit01** for the first unit.


### Create a Team Reflection Document

Throughout the entire semester, you must maintain a team reflection document. 
This is a single document, one per team, in which you reflect over teamwork and roles.
After each team activity you visit this document and add an entry for the week.

The team reflection document is also part of your final portfolio. 
It is not graded, but contributes as context for grading all other deliveries.

- Find the template for the team reflection document in the 'General' channel on Teams. It has the name `Team Reflection Template.docx`.
- Make a copy, replace the `Template` with your two-digit team number, and place it in the 'Shared' section of the public channel for your team.
- Since this is a document you will need every week, you should store it under the **root directory of your channel**. You can also make a Tab out of it, if you want.

### Team Roles for This Week

Have a quick look again at the [team roles](learning-teamwork.html) that you have read through during the preparation.

- Assign the roles for this week.
- Go through the tasks of the roles and find out if you have the same understanding about them.

### Time Check

Try to briefly get an overview of today's tasks, and come up with a rough time plan. Don't forget to schedule some breaks, too.

:aside: This team setup (assigning roles and planning your time) should become a normal routine for each week. 


### Find a Team Name

- Find a name you like.
- Put it also in the **Team Reflection** document.

### Picture

- Take a picture together.
- Annotate the picture with your names. 
- Put the picture into your Team document.
- Copy your picture also in the document "Team Pictures.pptx" on Teams.


### Create a Week Entry

Create an entry for this week as a new section.

### Attendance

Note the attendance of the team members during the week. 
If someone is missing, try to find out why and make a note.  


_We will come back to the team reflection document at the end._
