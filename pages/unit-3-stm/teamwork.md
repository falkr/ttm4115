# State Machines

Until now, you have learned about all the features that we need for state machines, but you have not yet created one on your own.


Revisit the [preparation material on how to create state machines](unit-statemachines-creation.html).
Assign one in the group who guides a brief summary through the points, and discuss any things that you may need clarification for. 

This is just to ensure that you remember the proceedings as you will need them today.
