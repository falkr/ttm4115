## Question 1

:rat:Which is the document that primarily covers the business requirements for a system?

1. Software Requirements Specification (Document)
2. Business Requirements Document
3. Vision and Scope Document
4. User Requirements Document

## Question 2

:rat:A developer adds features that are not in direct correspondence to a user requirement. This is called:

1. Feature Creep
2. Ambiguosity
3. Inaccurate planning
4. Gold Plating

## Question 3

:rat:Which types of requirements are closest to the developer?

1. functional requirements
2. business requirements
3. user requirements
4. system requirements

## Question 4

:rat:What can be categorized as non-functional requirements?
1. Quality attributes of a system, such as performance, safety, availability and portability.
2. Requirements for external interfaces between system and environment.
3. Other design and implementation constraints.

1. Only items named under 1).
2. Items named under 1) and 2).
3. Items named under 2) and 3).
4. Items named under 1) and 2) and 3).

## Question 5

:rat:When should you stop with analyzing requirements?

1. When all user requirements are covered.
2. Requirements engineering is never finished.
3. A rule of thumb recommends to proceed with use case development after 30 percent of expected project time.
4. When the understanding of the product is good enough for the construction of the next portion.

## Question 6

:rat:What is the relationship between product features and requirements?

1. A product feature is described by a set of functional requirements.
2. A product feature corresponds to a functional requirement.
3. A product feature corresponds to a functional requirement and  (optional) non-functional requirements.
4. A product feature is not directly mentioned by any requirements, since features regard the structure of the product to build, not what it should do.

## Question 7

:rat:What is a use case?

1. A use case describes a sequence of interactions between a system and an external actor.
2. A use case describes the system context for requirements.
3. A use case summarizes several system requirements.
4. A use case summarizes several non-functional system requirements.

## Question 8

:rat:What is the main source for the use cases?

1. The main source for creating use cases are the functional requirements.
2. The main source for creating use cases are the functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Use cases are created based on information provided by customers and users.
4. Use cases are specified by the users of a system.

## Question 9

:rat:What about actors in the context of a use case?

1. Actors are responsible to execute a use case.
2. An actor is always a person.
3. An actor represents a stakeholder of the system.
4. An actor represents a person, software system or hardware device.

## Question 10

:rat:What are use cases *not* intended for?

1. Identifying gaps of knowledge about the system.
2. Estimating the effort it will take to build the system.
3. Structuring the system into its components.
4. Constructing tests for the system.

## Question 11

:rat:Is it a good idea to directly implement from use cases?

1. No. Use cases only show the user's perspective towards the system and are hence incomplete.
2. Yes. If use cases are detailed enough, developers can directly implement from them.
3. Yes. Use cases are derived from functional requirements and are therefore sufficient for implementing.
4. No. Use cases are only an illustration of the system's functionality.

## Question 12

:rat:What is the most important benefit of a user-centric approach, in which use cases play an important role?

1. It leads to intuitive user interfaces.
2. It helps to prevent orphan user interfaces.
3. It helps to prevent implementing features no one will use.
4. It helps to ensure that users will use the system correctly.

## Question 13

:rat:Which of the following is a good use case name, according to the book?

1. Change Seats
2. As a customer, I want to change seats.
3. Seat Change
4. Changing Seats and Boarding
