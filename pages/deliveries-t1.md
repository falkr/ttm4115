# Delivery T1: Requirements

This delivery is a partial Vision and Scope document that focuses on why the system exists and what it should do, 
but without all detailed requirements listed. 

This delivery shows already a part of the system solution, by illustrating it with a deployment diagram.



## Grading

**Grading:** You don't receive a grade for this document directly. You will receive feedback on its content from other students, and will re-submit all content as part of the final submission. However, the better this initial submission is, the easier it is to receive valuable comments, and the easier it will be to create a very good final version. (So simply assume that already this version is graded.)

**Rejection:** Since this document is the basis for further work, we may reject it if it does not meet some criteria, both in form or content. You will then need to re-submit an improved version.


# Content

The delivery must contain the following sections:

### 1. Background
 
**Task:** Provide a brief description of the problem you want to solve. It should provide the context so that the reader can understand your vision in the next section.

**Evaluation:** Clearness of the description.

**Hints:** Length should be maximum half a page. Do not only use bullets, but prefer complete sentences. Focus rather on the problem than the system.


### 2. Vision	
* **Task:** Provide a vision for the system to build. All team members should be aware of this vision and share it. Be concise and specific.
* **Evaluation:** Clearness, quality of the vision, formulation.
* **Hints:** State the vision as well-formulated sentences, not bullets. Where needed, use bold or italic text. The vision should be ca. ¼ th of a page.


### 3. Objectives

* **Task:** State at least three objectives. Objectives are goals that your system can achieve. They need to be specific, and they need to be verifiable. State the objective, and state how it can be verified.
* **Evaluation:** Plausibility of the goal, plausibility of the verification of the goal, formulation.
* **Hints:** Describe the objectives, not the features of the system.


### 4. Stakeholders
	
* **Task:** Identify the main stakeholders in the system. Identify their values and interest. Present all in a table.
* **Evaluation:** Completeness, plausibility.
* **Hints:** Expected length: around one page


### 5. Use Case Diagram for Overview	

* **Task:** Present a use case diagram that covers the major features of your system.
* **Evaluation:** Completeness, plausibility, correctness of syntax, layout, clarity.
* **Hints:** Present a use case diagram that covers the major features of your system. Most likely, the use case diagram will fit on a single A4 page in landscape orientation. This diagram can show more use cases than you will detail in the next task.   **This diagram type is shown in the compendium, page 149.** 


### 6. Use Cases in Table Form

* **Task:** Write 3 use cases for the major features of your system. Choose use cases at the sea-level. Follow the table format proposed in the book, and shown on page 150.
* **Evaluation:** Completeness, plausibility, correctness of syntax, layout, clarity.
* **Hints:** Most likely, each of the use cases will fit on a single A4 page in portrait orientation. (So use about 3 pages in total.)

### 7. Deployment Diagram

* **Tasks:** Present a first version of a deployment diagram of your system. Identify the main execution nodes of your system and how they are connected. Identify critical hardware components (even if you later chose to simulate them.) Identify communication protocols that you are already aware of, and identify execution environments.
* **Evaluation:** Completeness, plausibility, correctness of syntax, layout, clarity.
* **Hints:** Most likely, the deployment diagram will fit on a single A4 page in landscape orientation.



# Formatting Rules for Deliveries

* Start each section on a new page. 
* Make sure to include team name on each page, in the header or footer of the document.
* Filename: **ttm4115-2018-XX-team-YY.pdf**, where XX is the delivery, like `T1` and YY is your team number, for instance 01 or 13. Consistent file name makes it much easier for us to process all deliveries!
* Diagrams can be included in landscape format, but must be readable from the right. (That means, they must be readable when the page is turned 90 degrees clockwise.
