# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks lets you execute Python interactively in your browser by running snippets of code in cells.
The newer Jupyter Lab has more functionality as you can have several notebooks opened in the same browser tab.


## Install Jupyter Lab

Follow the instructions on this page to [install Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).


## Running Notebooks

* Details are [explained here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running)
* Usually, typing `jupyter lab` on your terminal is enough.
* A browser opens, by default to `http://localhost:8888`
* Navigate with the integrated file browser to the notebook you want to open, for example the ones you download form this course.

I recommend that you get used to lab and notebooks and routined at using them. They are super useful for all kinds of stuff, and I am using them daily. 


## Binder

If you don't manage to install Jupyter notebooks and run them, you can also try to use the following website that lets you use a notebook online with noetbooks you downloaded from a Git repository.
