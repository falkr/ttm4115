# Delivery I2



## Feedback on T2

Provide feedback to the T2 delivery of another team. 

* Address all relevant issues you find. 
* Be guided by the [criteria given for T2](deliveries-t2.html).
* Discuss any clarifications or additions to the grading criteria on Piazza.
* Pay extra attention on the team's request for comments and feedback.
* See if you agree or diagree with their own evaluation.
* Try to be as direct as possible.
* Be constructive and try to suggest improvements. Focus on that the feedback is useful to the team. It should improve their next delivery.
* You can weave your feedback into the team's own reflection, in Word format. 
* It's okay to include screenshots (maybe partial ones) that you annotate if that makes things easier. (Then you may need more space than indicated above.)
* The feedback you give is not anonymous. This is on purpose, so a team might ask you for clarifications (though this is probably not necessary).
