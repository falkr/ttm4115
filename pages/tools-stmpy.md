# STMPY - State Machines in Python

The example implementations in this course are based on state machines in Python. For that, we use a library called STMPY. I've built it for this course and education purposes, so you have code that is (reasonably) easy to understand, low in complexity and easily accessible. 

STMPY is open source and free software. You are free to use it in your own projects. Contributions are welcome.

## STMPY Components

Have a look at the [STMPY Components repository](https://github.com/falkr/stmpy-components). It provides examples how to make a component that contains state machines and that communicates via MQTT and JSON.
